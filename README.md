# Role and practice of research software development at DLR
The repository contains the results of a survey concerning
the role and practice of research software development at
the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The survey started 
end of November 2018 and ended mid-February 2019. We received
773 answers which gave us interesting insights concerning developer
demographics, tool usage, documentation, testing as well as
software citation at DLR.

- [the survey questionnaire](01_survey-questions/questions.md),
- [the anonymized survey results](02_survey-results/data.csv) as well as
- [the analysis of the survey results](03_survey-analysis).
